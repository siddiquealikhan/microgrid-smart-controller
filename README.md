## Problem Statement
Microgrids are critical components of modern energy infrastructure, providing localized generation, storage, and consumption capabilities. However, their increasing reliance on digital communication and control systems makes them vulnerable to cyber-attacks, which can disrupt operations, compromise data integrity, and cause severe damage to connected loads and equipment.  
The challenge lies in designing a controller that is both intelligent for operational efficiency and resilient against evolving cyber threats, while being feasible to implement and test in a software-based environment.

## Overview
This project designs and implements a **cyber-security enabled smart controller** for a grid-connected microgrid in a simulation environment.  
The system integrates:
- **Microgrid simulation** using MATLAB/Simulink or Python Pandapower
- **Cyber-attack simulation** using Linux-based penetration tools
- **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)** for lightweight secure communication
- **Blockchain-based logging** for tamper-proof event records
- **Hybrid anomaly detection** combining threshold-based and machine learning methods
- **Real-time visualization and control dashboard** built in React.js

The implementation is software-only but designed to be extendable to hardware platforms in the future.

## Novelty Features
- **Integrated Security Stack:** Combines ECC encryption, blockchain logging, and hybrid anomaly detection in one unified platform.
- **Lightweight Cryptography:** ECC chosen for low-latency and resource-efficient secure communication.
- **Tamper-Proof Event Storage:** Blockchain ensures integrity and traceability of critical logs.
- **Hybrid Detection:** Threshold rules for fast anomaly detection + ML models for advanced threat identification.
- **Linux-Based Attack Simulation:** Realistic penetration tests using Scapy, hping3, mitmproxy, and Ettercap.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** React.js frontend for real-time monitoring and control.
- **Software-Only Prototype:** Allows demonstration without requiring specialized hardware, with flexibility for future hardware integration.
